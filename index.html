    <h2>My hobbies are...</h2>
    <p><storng>I love swimming, reading and listening to music.</storng></p>
    <p>Swimming feels great in the summer heat when the water is luke warm</p>
    <p>Reading  is a perfect hobby for rainy days and when the weather doesn't allow you to go out</p>
    <p>Listening to music helps me a lot in general. It's not affected by the weather or your whereabouts. <strong>Music is everywhere and anywhere.</strong></p>
